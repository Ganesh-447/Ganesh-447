## Projects

- **Hybrid Automation Framework**
  
  This project showcases a Hybrid Automation Framework incorporating Model-Driven Development (MDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Data-Driven Testing (DDT) methodologies. The framework is designed using the Page Object Model for enhanced maintainability and scalability.

  **Key Features:**
  - **Technologies/Libraries Used:**
    - Allure-Pytest: for generating comprehensive test reports.
    - Selenium: for web automation.
    - Pytest: for test execution and management.
    - Pytest-xdist: for running tests in parallel.
    - Pytest-html: for generating HTML test reports.
    - Page Object Model: for organizing test code into reusable components.
    - Data-Driven Testing (DDT): for parameterizing tests and reading test data from external files.
  
  **Functionality Implemented:**
  - Automated login functionality to an application (e.g., VWO site) using Selenium WebDriver.
  - Utilized the Page Object Model to create modular and reusable test components.
  - Implemented Data-Driven Testing (DDT) to read test data from external files.
  - Executed tests in parallel using Pytest-xdist for faster feedback.
  - Utilized `assert` statements from Pytest to verify expected outputs and ensure test correctness.
  - Generated detailed HTML and Allure reports for test execution analysis.
  - Integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration and automated test execution.

  **Additional Points:**
  - Maintained clear separation of concerns by utilizing a conftest file for configuring test environments and fixtures.
  - Implemented error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness of tests.
  - Included logging functionality for enhanced test traceability and debugging.
  - Followed coding best practices and coding standards to ensure code quality and readability.
  - Leveraged Dotenv for securely storing sensitive information such as usernames and passwords, ensuring test case security and confidentiality.

### Project 2: API Automation

This project focuses on automating API testing for the Restful Booker app, allowing users to perform booking, retrieving information, updating, and deleting data using authorization, used all HTTP methods.

**Key Features:**
- **Technologies/Libraries Used:**
  - Allure-Pytest: for generating comprehensive test reports.
  - Requests: for sending HTTP requests and handling responses.
  - Pytest: for test execution and management.
  - Pytest-html: for generating HTML test reports.
  - Pytest-xdist: for running tests in parallel.
  - Excel: for reading test data and elements.
  - Python-dotenv: for managing environment variables and sensitive information.
  - Faker: for generating fake data for testing purposes.
  - JSON Schema: for validating API responses against a predefined schema.

**Project Structure:**
- **src:** Contains the source code for the API automation framework.
- **constants:** Stores URLs and other constants used in the tests.
- **utils:** Includes utilities such as request wrappers for sending HTTP requests and handling responses.
- **test:** Contains the test cases for the API endpoints.
- **conftest:** Configures test environments and fixtures.

**Functionality Implemented:**
- Automated testing of various API endpoints (e.g., booking, retrieving, updating, and deleting data).
- Utilized authorization mechanisms to perform authorized API requests.
- Utilized Excel for reading test data and elements, enhancing test data management.
- Validated API responses against predefined JSON schemas to ensure data integrity and compliance with specifications.
- Executed test cases in parallel using Pytest-xdist for faster feedback.
- Integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration and automated test execution.

**Additional Points:**
- Followed RESTful API testing best practices.
- Implemented reusable components and utilities to maintain a scalable and maintainable test suite.
- Included comprehensive test reports generated by Allure-Pytest for detailed test analysis.
